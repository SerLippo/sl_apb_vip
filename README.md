# APB_VIP

​This apb vip is designed for APB2, APB3, APB4 protocols. The verison can be configured in the testcase level.

There're two agents for APB protocol. The test environment is simply connected by one master agent and one slave agent. And there're some simple tests for checking out the protocols.
